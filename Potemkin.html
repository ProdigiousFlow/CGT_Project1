        <h1>Potemkin</h1>

        <img class="portrait" src="images/potemkin.png" alt="Pot">

        <p class="bio">A giant walking fortress who can turn the match around with his powerful grabs.
            He is a soldier from the Independent Airborne State of Zepp.
            He's a proud man with a loyal heart.
            His stature makes him come off as intimidating, but he's a gentle man who loves nature.
            He values duty above all, and while he can tolerate his own pain, he cannot bear to see others hurt. He faces adversity head-on.
            He refuses to be used as a tool to hurt others for evil.
            Potemkin has a hard time getting in on his opponent and is quite slow, but if he does get close it could spell defeat
            for them. His potemkin buster special move does massive damage and puts him into a significant advantage state.
