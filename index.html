            <p class="paragraph"> The Guilty Gear: Strive Resource Hub is a place 
                designed to help beginners to Guilty Gear and the fighting genre
                by giving them ample resources to get into the game and more deeply
                understand the intricate mechanics the game has to offer for a deeper and more
                enjoyable experience. Here you will find guides with combos, gameplay advice,
                and important information regarding characters in the roster that are good for beginners. You can also
                find guides for fighting games as a whole for people who are entirely new
                to fighting games and need that extra help. The discord is also available
                for more personal advise. </p>
