        <h1>Axl Low</h1>
        
        <img class="portrait" src="Images/axl.png" alt="Axl2">

        <p class="bio">A long range attacker who can take opponents down at a distance.
            A young man from the 20th century with the ability to manipulate time.
            A typical optimist who doesn't take things too seriously and just goes with the flow.
            He is compassionate to a fault and could never ignore somebody in trouble.
            He despises the very idea of "death" and would never resort to taking a life, no matter the situation
            Axl likes to keep his distance from his opponent, hitting them with long range pokes and keeping them 
            where he wants. Though he prefers long distance, his time stop super provides him very good close up damage as well.
